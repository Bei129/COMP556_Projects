- Test1 and Test2
These tests primarily focus on whether poison reverse functions correctly when changing link costs:
Topology: A triangular topology is constructed, with events designed to simulate changes in link delays, specifically increasing the delay of the link between nodes 1 and 2.
Key Objectives:
   1. Test if, after the delay on link 1-2 increases, the path 1 → 3 → 2 becomes optimal, and the DV protocol can:
      - Detect the path change correctly.
      - Update the routing table appropriately.
      - Apply the poison reverse rule correctly.     
      - Avoid routing loops.

- Test3 and Test4
These tests focus on the behavior of the protocol during link failures and recoveries:
Topology: A network with five nodes is created, including an intentionally high-delay link (3-5: 400ms).
Key Test Scenarios:
   1. When the link between nodes 2 and 3 fails and recovers, test if the protocol can:
      - Detect the link state changes in a timely manner.
      - Switch to an alternative path correctly.
      - Ensure poison reverse rules remain effective during link failures.
      - Converge back to the optimal path after the link recovers.

- Test5 and Test6
These tests focus on performance of Dijkstra’s algorithm in a larger-scale network:
Topology: A 10-node network, including multiple links with varying delays to create clear optimal and suboptimal paths.
Key Objectives:
   - Validate the correctness of path calculations under a more complex topology.
   - Test the efficiency of path computation in larger networks.
   - Assess routing convergence performance during link state changes.
   - Evaluate the overall efficiency of the protocol in handling a larger-scale network.

- Test7 and Test8
These tests primarily focus on large-scale topologies with a significant number of nodes.  
Topology: The networks consist of 30 and 40 nodes respectively, covering most scenarios.  
Key Objectives:  
   - Memory utilization for large routing tables.
   - Performance under complex failure scenarios.
   - Processing efficiency with numerous paths.
   - Correct convergence in complex topologies.
